1
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,560
Happy birthday to me!

2
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:53,711
Happy birthday!

3
00:01:02,618 --> 00:01:04,268
- Oh, my God!
- Anybody want this?

4
00:01:10,826 --> 00:01:13,546
That's what happens
when you do a mercy invite.

5
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:16,249
I believed you wanted to invite everyone.

6
00:01:16,332 --> 00:01:19,322
Dad, I can't invite everyone in
my art class except for one person

7
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:21,261
without social networking evidence

8
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,427
inflicting more pain on that
person than was intended.

9
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:24,555
And I'm not a monster.

10
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,500
I'm proud of you. I think.

11
00:01:27,576 --> 00:01:31,926
She gets detention a lot and she yells
at teachers sometimes.

12
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:35,843
There was that rumor that went around
that she just kept running away from home.

13
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:36,837
Um, maybe she can Uber.

14
00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:38,808
I seriously believe that we can go home now.

15
00:01:38,887 --> 00:01:41,477
Um, did I mistakenly convey
this was a democracy?

16
00:01:41,557 --> 00:01:44,327
We are not going till she gets picked up.

17
00:01:46,895 --> 00:01:51,185
Uh, the car broke down.
I'm just gonna take the bus.

18
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:53,417
You're not taking a bus.
I'll drive you home.

19
00:01:53,502 --> 00:01:55,792
Claire has almost saved her half
of the money she needs for a car.

20
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:57,291
Isn't that right?

21
00:01:57,373 --> 00:02:01,343
This'll be one of the few times left
I can drive you guys around. Huh?

22
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:03,968
Uh, I...

23
00:02:04,045 --> 00:02:07,735
You won't be able to hear my dad tell
jokes that only he thinks are funny

24
00:02:07,816 --> 00:02:10,566
for an entire car ride unless you come.

25
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:12,592
You don't really wanna miss that.

26
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:21,545
Wow! I got more gifts than I thought I did.

27
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,649
Can I put this in here?

28
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:27,463
Yeah, I'll get it. Thank you, Marcia.

29
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:28,556
Maybe he just is into...

30
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:32,541
Maybe he's just content where he is.

31
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:43,016
Hey. Can I help you?

32
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:46,511
What?

33
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:48,638
This is the one. He's really funny.

34
00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:51,354
He does these weekly videos.

35
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:56,552
See? It's so random. That is so weird.

36
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:00,717
Yeah, you have a crush on him.

37
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:01,592
- I don't get it.
- Pause it.

38
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,620
- Yeah, go back.
- Why don't you get it?

39
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:05,464
- I just don't get it.
- He's blond and he's cute.

40
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,561
No, his eyebrows are just like...

41
00:03:07,643 --> 00:03:08,763
Shut up. His eyebrows?

42
00:03:08,844 --> 00:03:10,004
That's the one thing you couldn't get?

43
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:11,498
Yeah.

44
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,989
Oh, my God.

45
00:03:21,523 --> 00:03:24,383
Oh. You see what he does, though?

46
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,050
How does he even do that?

47
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:27,477
That's the whole point why I'm showing you.

48
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:28,903
Genius!

49
00:03:30,031 --> 00:03:31,451
So bad.

50
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:44,874
Hey!

51
00:03:44,946 --> 00:03:46,946
Pardon me, sir.
I think you have the wrong car.

52
00:06:29,678 --> 00:06:31,108
We woke up in here.

53
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:41,255
What the hell is going on?

54
00:06:42,157 --> 00:06:43,807
What are we doing here?

55
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:45,852
What happened to my dad?

56
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,097
He's out there.

57
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:52,125
Do you know what happened to my dad?

58
00:07:46,187 --> 00:07:48,157
I choose you first.

59
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:56,726
It's only gonna be a minute.

60
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,590
Pee on yourself.

61
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:05,032
Pee on yourself.

62
00:08:07,308 --> 00:08:08,108
No!

63
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:18,615
No.

64
00:08:19,187 --> 00:08:20,087
No!

65
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:23,193
No!

66
00:08:23,424 --> 00:08:24,634
No!

67
00:08:25,393 --> 00:08:27,363
Open the door!

68
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:44,851
Hey, are you okay?

69
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:48,848
He wanted me to dance for him.

70
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:58,288
The outside door is locked.

71
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,930
Everything's okay.

72
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:07,341
We're okay.

73
00:09:09,705 --> 00:09:10,705
We're okay.

74
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:22,697
I hear the tiniest little splash
and here it comes.

75
00:09:22,784 --> 00:09:25,374
A freak of nature, like this.

76
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:27,683
So, he comes across the stream

77
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:32,276
and he's so tall that the water
doesn't even get to his belly.

78
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,380
Then he stops.

79
00:09:34,462 --> 00:09:37,172
And my heart's coming out of my chest.

80
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:40,186
You got buck fever.

81
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:43,388
Uncle John's got buck fever.

82
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:45,131
That's not true, Casey.
Your daddy's a liar.

83
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:46,356
How big was the rack?

84
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:48,061
It was huge.

85
00:09:48,143 --> 00:09:49,773
Where are you supposed to
look when you shoot, Casey?

86
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:50,925
At the body.

87
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:52,232
Then why was he looking at the rack?

88
00:09:52,313 --> 00:09:54,253
'Cause he had buck fever.

89
00:09:55,751 --> 00:09:57,141
She'll say anything you say.

90
00:09:57,218 --> 00:10:00,218
You gonna do that when you get your
mentored hunting license in three years?

91
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:02,409
No, sir.

92
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,080
Make sure you put your
gloves on after you finish.

93
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,260
Your feet and your hands
get cold first out there.

94
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:37,281
Three students abducted.

95
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:41,278
The father of one of the students woke up
dazed in King of Prussia, reportedly drugged.

96
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:43,992
He found the kids and the car missing.

97
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:45,985
Neighbors are in disbelief.

98
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:49,367
A normally quiet community
is reeling after this abduction.

99
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:54,302
If you have any information concerning
the whereabouts of these girls,

100
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,475
you are urged to contact the police.

101
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:16,124
It doesn't matter
if you open that door, Claire.

102
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:19,287
There's a second locked door.

103
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:21,487
He's gonna come in here again, any second,

104
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:24,009
and we're not letting him
take one of us out again.

105
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:29,261
We just cried and screamed
and we didn't hurt him

106
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:32,134
because we were afraid to get him upset.

107
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:35,073
God, that's victim shit. Jesus!

108
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,240
We should fight him.

109
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:39,448
We should drop a crazy-ass bomb on him.

110
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:43,831
I saw him carry one of you and lay you
on the bed like you weighed nothing.

111
00:11:45,393 --> 00:11:47,403
One punch from him would knock one of us out.

112
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:52,016
I took six months of Kenpo karate class.

113
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,960
And you distract the assailant with pain.

114
00:11:55,036 --> 00:11:58,156
Everything is so easy for you guys.

115
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,339
You do one thing, you can
predict the next thing.

116
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:05,504
It's not the way it's gonna be
in this situation.

117
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,500
We're not getting out of here.

118
00:12:07,582 --> 00:12:10,322
You're saying that you're not gonna
fight with everything in you?

119
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:14,206
You know the only chance...

120
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:18,389
The only chance we have is if
all three of us go crazy on this guy.

121
00:12:20,328 --> 00:12:22,358
We have to hurry.

122
00:12:26,034 --> 00:12:28,894
We need you, Casey.

123
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,510
Claire's smart. Let's listen to her.

124
00:12:32,673 --> 00:12:35,413
I'll do it if you're gonna do it, too.

125
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:39,269
We can win.

126
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:40,517
He'll hurt us.

127
00:12:41,983 --> 00:12:44,253
No. Shut up.

128
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,380
Both of you.

129
00:12:47,455 --> 00:12:51,085
You're gonna pick your miserable
self up and help us get out of here.

130
00:12:53,128 --> 00:12:55,418
Blow me.

131
00:12:55,496 --> 00:12:59,046
And your six months of karate at the
King of Prussia Mall can blow me, too.

132
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:01,164
No! No, no, you can't do this today!

133
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:03,056
You can't do this right now.

134
00:13:03,138 --> 00:13:04,988
Why do you do this?
Why do you act like this?

135
00:13:05,073 --> 00:13:06,443
Why do you act like you're not one of us?

136
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,380
When you're aiming, Casey,

137
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,040
always keep both eyes open.

138
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:23,609
Cover your target with the barrel
then move with it to get its pace.

139
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:26,381
I'm warning you,
it's gonna be frustrating the first times.

140
00:13:26,461 --> 00:13:29,121
You're gonna shoot under it or behind it.

141
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:30,597
You'll learn to stay with it.

142
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,223
Females are smarter than the males.

143
00:13:34,302 --> 00:13:35,962
But you know that, it's like humans.

144
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:40,062
Females use their nose to stay alive.

145
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:42,431
They make sure they have cover.

146
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,570
They always remember they're
trying to stay alive.

147
00:13:45,646 --> 00:13:48,436
Bucks go off by themselves.

148
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:51,336
Bucks get dumb during mating season.

149
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:54,039
Boys make too much noise.

150
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:56,282
Yes, they do.

151
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:58,027
I'm better than a boy, right?

152
00:13:59,527 --> 00:14:01,077
Yes, you are.

153
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:02,132
Hey.

154
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:11,136
I'll let you know when I hear
something that makes sense.

155
00:14:14,742 --> 00:14:16,982
We don't even know what this is yet.

156
00:14:23,284 --> 00:14:25,454
Hey! I was inspired.

157
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:32,111
No, no, no, that one.

158
00:14:32,193 --> 00:14:34,553
That one, before the pink
frock coat with the thorns.

159
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:37,089
That's supposed to be like a tailored jacket,

160
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:39,495
but I'm gonna hand-print it
with newspaper headlines.

161
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:45,968
I'm a simple blouse and
skirt person, but these...

162
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:51,329
These are very artistic, Barry.

163
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:55,742
Just the kind of thing Hamptons
ladies would spend $15,000 on

164
00:14:55,816 --> 00:14:58,006
to wear once at a charity ball.

165
00:14:58,086 --> 00:14:59,706
Shut up!

166
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:02,237
You know, I can't stay too long.

167
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:04,083
This is just a visit.

168
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,989
Well, tell me what's going on.

169
00:15:07,828 --> 00:15:09,548
What, you mean the email?

170
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,050
No, just the usual things.

171
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:12,522
Just feelings of being overwhelmed.

172
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,090
The terseness of your email made it
sound specific and time-related.

173
00:15:17,172 --> 00:15:18,762
Are you looking for something?

174
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,459
- No.
- No?

175
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,331
I'm just admiring. I'm better now.

176
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,560
How's work?

177
00:15:23,644 --> 00:15:24,734
It's great.

178
00:15:24,812 --> 00:15:26,602
When I last spoke to them,

179
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:29,641
they believed you were a model employee.

180
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:33,467
They found you meticulous and conscientious.

181
00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:35,314
- You know this, right?
- I do.

182
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,150
You've managed there for 10 years.

183
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:38,685
You're functioning very well, Barry.

184
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:43,381
And it's a rare and wonderful
place for you to work.

185
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:45,124
Yes, it is.

186
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,220
You know, of all my other
clients with your disorder,

187
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:50,713
you've been the most consistent at your job.

188
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:54,483
Did something happen, Barry?

189
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,610
How old are you?

190
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:01,274
Just... The Internet is
inconsistent on this point.

191
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:03,469
Why is that on your mind?

192
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:07,111
Who's gonna look after us
when you retire or pass on?

193
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:09,608
You know, we're gonna have
to take care of ourselves

194
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,650
and nobody even believes that we exist.

195
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:14,516
If ever something were to happen to me,

196
00:16:14,595 --> 00:16:17,665
I've made arrangements with a colleague
from Baltimore to take over.

197
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,089
Hmm.

198
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:21,298
Hey, do you, uh...

199
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:23,289
You live alone?

200
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:24,731
You know this.

201
00:16:24,805 --> 00:16:26,485
I'm sorry, I just meant how long?

202
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:27,684
Always.

203
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:32,378
That must be so lonely.

204
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,310
Uh, you know what?

205
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,450
I'm doing much better. I shouldn't
have emailed you. I'm just...

206
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:47,326
Look at me. I'm too impulsive.

207
00:16:50,898 --> 00:16:54,218
By the way, is anybody listening?

208
00:16:54,302 --> 00:16:55,792
Does anybody care about us?

209
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,060
Yes.

210
00:16:57,138 --> 00:17:00,298
The University of Paris has asked
me to do a lecture, in fact.

211
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,495
I'm going to be doing it
via Skype from right here.

212
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:06,248
People are believing more.

213
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:09,799
Let's meet at our usual time next week.

214
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:12,194
I would rather you didn't leave, Barry.

215
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:16,138
Did something happen?

216
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:17,554
Don't worry.

217
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,705
This was just a visit.

218
00:17:18,793 --> 00:17:20,383
I'm doing much better, I actually...

219
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:22,881
Don't you want your sketches, Barry?

220
00:17:22,963 --> 00:17:25,273
You're usually very protective of them.

221
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:27,767
Yeah.

222
00:17:28,403 --> 00:17:29,403
Thanks.

223
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,610
I'll see you next week at our usual time.

224
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:38,751
Thanks for fighting for us, Dr. Fletcher.

225
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:52,809
Thanks, Dr. Fletcher.

226
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:54,583
Welcome.

227
00:17:54,662 --> 00:17:55,582
I just think I'm gonna blow it.

228
00:17:55,663 --> 00:17:57,693
No, you'll be great.
I'll see you next week.

229
00:17:57,765 --> 00:17:58,725
Okay, thank you.

230
00:18:05,373 --> 00:18:07,663
...DJ's exclusive million dollar

231
00:18:07,742 --> 00:18:10,602
Holiday Bucks Bonanza.

232
00:18:10,678 --> 00:18:12,948
I don't know how you work with those people.

233
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:15,369
What people?

234
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,310
Your patients.

235
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:22,235
You can't use your thumbs
to spin the wheel, dumbasses.

236
00:18:22,323 --> 00:18:24,493
They always use their thumbs. Oh.

237
00:18:27,562 --> 00:18:31,632
Well, we look at people who've been
shattered and different as less than.

238
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:33,903
What if...

239
00:18:35,002 --> 00:18:36,902
they're more than us?

240
00:18:37,772 --> 00:18:38,812
What?

241
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,513
Do you believe them? Your patients.

242
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,400
Just between you and me.

243
00:18:47,482 --> 00:18:48,782
- Yes, I do.
- Hmm.

244
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,640
Flick it! Flick it!

245
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,310
...coming up next, right after this.

246
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,910
I don't believe it.

247
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:59,251
- No offense.
- No.

248
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:02,317
...but when you call, we'll send you
a second easy-feet absolutely free!

249
00:19:02,397 --> 00:19:03,877
Just pay separate processing.

250
00:19:03,964 --> 00:19:05,324
So that's two easy feet...

251
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,300
Now, that, I need to buy that.

252
00:19:11,406 --> 00:19:12,456
He's back.

253
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,480
There's a lady outside.

254
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,570
Dennis, admit what you've done.

255
00:19:26,654 --> 00:19:27,724
Don't get upset.

256
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:30,456
Don't tell me.

257
00:19:31,326 --> 00:19:32,926
I'm getting frightened.

258
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,690
I thought that you had this under control.

259
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:39,715
Please tell me it's not too late.

260
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,970
The food is waiting.

261
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:47,543
Is she in that room?

262
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:50,904
- We're here!
- Help us!

263
00:19:50,978 --> 00:19:52,368
We're in here!

264
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,767
What is this? How many are there?

265
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:55,368
No, don't go in there!

266
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,540
Don't go in there!

267
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:07,396
Don't worry.

268
00:20:09,764 --> 00:20:11,534
I'll talk to him.

269
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,770
He listens to me.

270
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,680
He's not well.

271
00:20:25,713 --> 00:20:27,973
He knows what you're here for.

272
00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:30,608
He's not allowed to touch you.

273
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:31,885
He knows that.

274
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:35,619
Mmm-mmm.

275
00:20:37,592 --> 00:20:38,832
Hmm?

276
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:05,308
Karen. Joe.

277
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:08,456
They said you can't have your own
panel at the national conference.

278
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:14,745
They conceded, however, that you can
be part of the mood disorder panel.

279
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:16,879
It's not a mood disorder.

280
00:21:16,964 --> 00:21:19,524
Oh, I'm aware of your beliefs, Karen.

281
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,690
Well, were they open this time
with the new evidence?

282
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,730
One of your arguments is a dog?

283
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:28,096
You submitted video of
a dog acting differently

284
00:21:28,175 --> 00:21:29,995
to one of your patients at different times?

285
00:21:30,077 --> 00:21:32,067
It is more dramatic than that.

286
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:34,936
They are what they believe they are.

287
00:21:35,015 --> 00:21:37,935
The brain has learned to defend itself.

288
00:21:38,018 --> 00:21:39,988
You speak of them like
they're supernaturally gifted.

289
00:21:40,955 --> 00:21:42,605
Like they have powers or something.

290
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,550
Karen, these are patients.

291
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,485
They have been through trauma.

292
00:21:49,497 --> 00:21:53,527
And perhaps now they are
capable of something we're not.

293
00:21:55,202 --> 00:21:58,432
We have brain scans now.

294
00:21:58,506 --> 00:22:03,036
DID patients have changed their
body chemistry with their thoughts.

295
00:22:06,481 --> 00:22:08,801
He's just trying to scare us.

296
00:22:08,883 --> 00:22:11,193
He was having a full
conversation with himself.

297
00:22:13,654 --> 00:22:16,884
What was that line about?
"The food is waiting."

298
00:22:16,957 --> 00:22:20,977
Does everyone get how wacked this is
and that we need to get out of here now?

299
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,790
No.

300
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:34,432
Please, keep your area neat.

301
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:36,129
The bathroom, it's unacceptable.

302
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,670
To make it easy, I've color-coded these.

303
00:22:38,746 --> 00:22:43,976
Use the blue bottle for the floor and
the pink bottle for the ceramic surfaces.

304
00:22:48,556 --> 00:22:49,916
Uh...

305
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:13,698
Patricia has reminded me that
I was sent to get you for a reason.

306
00:23:13,781 --> 00:23:16,581
That you are sacred food.

307
00:23:18,285 --> 00:23:20,715
And I promise not to bother you again.

308
00:23:34,101 --> 00:23:36,691
Maybe he has a dog or something.

309
00:23:36,771 --> 00:23:38,941
You think he's gonna feed us to his dogs?

310
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:14,073
Casey.

311
00:24:16,043 --> 00:24:17,043
Casey!

312
00:24:35,763 --> 00:24:37,223
My name's Hedwig.

313
00:24:37,297 --> 00:24:39,067
I have red socks.

314
00:24:45,773 --> 00:24:47,813
He's on the move.

315
00:24:50,778 --> 00:24:51,778
What?

316
00:24:55,716 --> 00:24:58,106
He's... on...

317
00:24:58,185 --> 00:24:59,605
the...

318
00:24:59,687 --> 00:25:01,117
move.

319
00:25:03,423 --> 00:25:04,693
Who?

320
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,650
Someone's coming for you

321
00:25:07,728 --> 00:25:10,618
and you're not gonna like it.

322
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:12,688
You guys make noises in your sleep.

323
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:13,767
Tell us.

324
00:25:14,835 --> 00:25:16,765
I'm not supposed to say.

325
00:25:18,072 --> 00:25:22,762
But he's done awful things to people
and he'll do awful things to you.

326
00:25:22,843 --> 00:25:24,263
I have blue socks, too.

327
00:25:24,344 --> 00:25:25,884
We're his food?

328
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,050
How old are you?

329
00:25:32,787 --> 00:25:33,947
Nine.

330
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:40,130
So you're not the guy that took us?

331
00:25:40,828 --> 00:25:42,158
No.

332
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:45,951
You're not the lady?

333
00:25:46,033 --> 00:25:48,293
What are you, blind?

334
00:25:48,368 --> 00:25:51,228
You don't know how they think?

335
00:25:51,305 --> 00:25:53,785
No, they don't tell me much.

336
00:25:53,874 --> 00:25:55,314
I just ate a hot dog.

337
00:25:56,911 --> 00:26:00,051
Could you help us, Hedwig?

338
00:26:01,782 --> 00:26:04,842
No, I'm not even supposed to be here.

339
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,909
I stole the light from Mr. Dennis,
but he'll be back real soon.

340
00:26:07,988 --> 00:26:12,078
I can't steal the light for too
long or he'll know and get angry.

341
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,329
Etcetera.

342
00:26:15,996 --> 00:26:17,076
See you!

343
00:26:17,164 --> 00:26:18,274
Wait.

344
00:26:22,002 --> 00:26:23,772
We heard something.

345
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:28,336
We didn't understand it,

346
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,350
but now we do.

347
00:26:34,181 --> 00:26:36,701
Do you know what we heard?

348
00:26:36,784 --> 00:26:38,394
What did you hear?

349
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,120
Come here.

350
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,130
I'll whisper it to you.

351
00:26:47,394 --> 00:26:48,404
Okay.

352
00:27:01,108 --> 00:27:02,238
This guy...

353
00:27:05,946 --> 00:27:07,916
is coming for you.

354
00:27:12,987 --> 00:27:14,407
You're a big fibber.

355
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:16,088
I never lie, Hedwig.

356
00:27:17,257 --> 00:27:19,807
But Mr. Dennis,

357
00:27:19,894 --> 00:27:22,884
he said that he followed
those two girls for four days

358
00:27:22,963 --> 00:27:25,093
and that he knew

359
00:27:25,165 --> 00:27:27,765
that they were the ones that he would want.

360
00:27:30,537 --> 00:27:32,787
When you're not around,

361
00:27:32,873 --> 00:27:35,103
Dennis and the lady talk about it.

362
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:38,065
They talk about how he wants a boy this time.

363
00:27:38,145 --> 00:27:39,495
They're going to give him you.

364
00:27:39,579 --> 00:27:42,399
No, Miss Patricia, she said...

365
00:27:42,482 --> 00:27:44,502
She said she's not mad at me anymore.

366
00:27:44,584 --> 00:27:46,774
She sings to me sometimes.

367
00:27:46,854 --> 00:27:49,764
I think Miss Patricia is
still a little mad at you.

368
00:27:50,825 --> 00:27:53,175
Miss Patricia thinks I'm...

369
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,830
She thinks I'm stupid.

370
00:27:56,263 --> 00:27:58,273
She thinks I make silly mistakes.

371
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:00,233
Look at me.

372
00:28:01,135 --> 00:28:03,335
We're like your babysitters.

373
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:08,179
We'll let you watch TV
and make you a fun dinner.

374
00:28:10,344 --> 00:28:13,134
We all need to get out of here.

375
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:15,543
You could show us the way out.

376
00:28:15,615 --> 00:28:18,135
We could be gone before anybody gets back,

377
00:28:18,218 --> 00:28:20,268
but we have to hurry, Hedwig.

378
00:28:20,354 --> 00:28:22,824
We have to hurry and get out of here.

379
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:27,456
Wait a minute.

380
00:28:29,096 --> 00:28:31,116
It took forever to get this place safe

381
00:28:31,198 --> 00:28:33,088
without the nosey bodies
that work here finding out.

382
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:35,017
You can't get out of here!

383
00:28:35,102 --> 00:28:36,192
I have to blow my nose.

384
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,440
No, wait! Please don't go!

385
00:28:40,174 --> 00:28:41,144
Who's coming?

386
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:44,299
This is seriously scary.

387
00:28:44,378 --> 00:28:45,508
No one's coming.

388
00:28:50,184 --> 00:28:51,824
He said something.

389
00:28:54,021 --> 00:28:57,521
He said something about making the room safe.

390
00:28:58,592 --> 00:29:00,192
This is all new drywall.

391
00:29:02,062 --> 00:29:03,332
What was unsafe?

392
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:39,328
Wait.

393
00:29:40,434 --> 00:29:42,074
Wait, are we sure about this?

394
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,390
Casey, you were right.

395
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:08,981
There's something here.

396
00:30:09,063 --> 00:30:11,053
He was covering up a way out.

397
00:30:11,131 --> 00:30:12,531
Tell me if you see him.

398
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,240
Casey, tell us what you see.

399
00:30:25,545 --> 00:30:27,425
He's here.

400
00:30:27,514 --> 00:30:29,204
You can't let him in! You can't let him in!

401
00:30:29,283 --> 00:30:30,423
This is our one chance.

402
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,210
We're not gonna make it.

403
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:35,458
Yes, we are!

404
00:30:44,131 --> 00:30:45,131
What?

405
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,426
Hey, what are you guys doing?

406
00:30:51,571 --> 00:30:52,571
Hey.

407
00:30:54,074 --> 00:30:55,584
Okay, quit it.

408
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,440
Okay, guys?

409
00:30:58,112 --> 00:30:59,232
Let me in.

410
00:30:59,313 --> 00:31:02,343
Give us a second. We're changing.

411
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:03,616
What are you guys doing?

412
00:31:05,652 --> 00:31:06,622
Let me in.

413
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:10,989
Guys, you're not being funny.

414
00:31:22,102 --> 00:31:24,292
You're being bitches!
Now, I'm gonna slap you!

415
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:25,431
I'm gonna slap you in your face.

416
00:31:25,505 --> 00:31:27,265
Just give me as much time as you can.

417
00:31:28,775 --> 00:31:31,025
You're gonna get me into trouble.

418
00:31:34,681 --> 00:31:35,971
Guys...

419
00:31:37,784 --> 00:31:39,254
All right, push up.

420
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:46,485
Hey!

421
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:52,628
Hey!

422
00:32:58,865 --> 00:33:00,465
Hey!

423
00:33:26,226 --> 00:33:28,526
I thought I lost you.

424
00:33:31,598 --> 00:33:32,868
Would you, uh...

425
00:33:34,301 --> 00:33:36,101
Would you step outside, please?

426
00:33:43,443 --> 00:33:45,533
You like to make fun of us.

427
00:33:45,612 --> 00:33:48,202
But we're more powerful than you think.

428
00:33:48,282 --> 00:33:49,782
Step outside.

429
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:53,552
Please.

430
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:04,529
You shouldn't trick children.

431
00:34:05,465 --> 00:34:07,525
That shows who you are.

432
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,660
Look at your sweater. It's ruined.

433
00:34:15,742 --> 00:34:17,242
It's dirty.

434
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:20,709
Remove it.

435
00:34:52,412 --> 00:34:53,712
I'm trying to be good.

436
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,420
You will not see your friend again.

437
00:35:14,534 --> 00:35:16,604
She will be kept separate.

438
00:35:19,706 --> 00:35:22,296
You take off your skirt.
You take off your shirt.

439
00:35:22,376 --> 00:35:24,336
Clothes you got all dirty from the dust.

440
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:53,757
One identity in an individual with
Dissociative Identity Disorder

441
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,990
can have high cholesterol.

442
00:35:55,074 --> 00:35:56,434
One.

443
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,430
There have been cases where one
identity is allergic to bee stings.

444
00:36:00,514 --> 00:36:02,204
The others are not.

445
00:36:02,282 --> 00:36:06,942
Are there moments where two identities
can coexist at the same time?

446
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,740
There are times when two identities

447
00:36:09,823 --> 00:36:13,313
can take the "light" or "the spot"

448
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:15,923
or consciousness at the same time.

449
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:18,885
This happened with a student
that I was working with.

450
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:22,985
And her left and right hand were taking notes

451
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:27,989
in different hand-writings about
separate things at the same time.

452
00:36:28,074 --> 00:36:31,804
The differences in the
identities can be dramatic.

453
00:36:31,878 --> 00:36:35,638
As much as the difference between you and me

454
00:36:35,715 --> 00:36:38,615
and every person in that auditorium.

455
00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:41,739
The identities have different IQ's.

456
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:43,781
They have different physical strengths.

457
00:36:43,857 --> 00:36:47,007
One personality is a Russian weightlifter

458
00:36:47,093 --> 00:36:50,923
and can lift three times his body weight.

459
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:53,817
Their ability to hyper-focus

460
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,000
and have different experiences is astounding.

461
00:36:59,906 --> 00:37:04,356
Have these individuals,
through their suffering,

462
00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:07,384
unlocked the potential of the brain?

463
00:37:08,915 --> 00:37:12,415
Is this the ultimate doorway

464
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,990
to all things we call unknown?

465
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:23,859
Is this where our sense of
the supernatural comes from?

466
00:37:37,611 --> 00:37:39,581
It's about depth

467
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:43,471
and curves...

468
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,970
Hey, you see that one?

469
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:46,891
It's kind of like a chenille sweater-dress.

470
00:37:51,124 --> 00:37:52,534
Who are you?

471
00:37:57,531 --> 00:37:58,731
Barry.

472
00:38:00,734 --> 00:38:01,904
I don't think you are.

473
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:06,533
I've developed a nose for sensing

474
00:38:06,606 --> 00:38:08,606
whom I'm talking to and whom I'm not.

475
00:38:09,943 --> 00:38:11,773
Have I done something?

476
00:38:11,845 --> 00:38:14,595
You've emailed for an unscheduled appointment

477
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:16,741
two days in a row.

478
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:18,646
We're just feeling overwhelmed.

479
00:38:19,453 --> 00:38:20,893
Garden-variety issues.

480
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:27,081
I think Orwell or Jade or Samuel or Heinrich

481
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,920
had the light for a moment and emailed me.

482
00:38:29,996 --> 00:38:32,486
And you're here to tell me everything's okay.

483
00:38:32,566 --> 00:38:34,096
I emailed you.

484
00:38:36,703 --> 00:38:38,773
May I talk to one of them, please?

485
00:38:43,477 --> 00:38:45,127
That can't happen.

486
00:38:45,211 --> 00:38:46,701
I...

487
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:50,480
I told them that I wanted to spend
the session with you today.

488
00:38:51,918 --> 00:38:54,808
I'm gonna ask again.

489
00:38:54,888 --> 00:38:58,648
To whom am I speaking with now?

490
00:38:58,725 --> 00:39:01,455
Dr. Fletcher, it's Barry.

491
00:39:02,195 --> 00:39:04,875
It doesn't seem like Barry.

492
00:39:04,964 --> 00:39:07,154
Barry is an extroverted leader.

493
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:08,603
Yes, I am.

494
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,430
I'm gonna take a professional guess

495
00:39:13,507 --> 00:39:17,157
based on the description of all 23 identities

496
00:39:17,243 --> 00:39:19,703
that live in Kevin's body,

497
00:39:19,779 --> 00:39:21,849
that I've gotten from Barry.

498
00:39:24,117 --> 00:39:27,787
I think I'm talking to Dennis.

499
00:39:31,124 --> 00:39:32,914
But he's been banned from the light

500
00:39:32,992 --> 00:39:35,582
because, among other reasons,

501
00:39:35,662 --> 00:39:39,992
he has a proclivity to watch
young girls dance naked,

502
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:41,916
which he himself knows is wrong

503
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:44,761
and has fought against with little success.

504
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:47,588
I'm encouraged we can finally meet.

505
00:39:47,674 --> 00:39:49,104
And I've guessed this

506
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:52,865
because you've adjusted the chocolate
dish twice since you came in here

507
00:39:52,946 --> 00:39:54,526
and I understand you have OCD.

508
00:39:55,982 --> 00:39:58,472
I see. Now, I see. That's clever.

509
00:39:58,552 --> 00:40:00,612
That's clever, but I'm not Dennis.

510
00:40:00,687 --> 00:40:03,707
And you and Patricia have
been banned from the light

511
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,650
for quite a while now.

512
00:40:05,725 --> 00:40:07,975
Primarily, shall we say,
because of your beliefs.

513
00:40:08,061 --> 00:40:10,521
Patricia and Dennis are very unstable.

514
00:40:10,597 --> 00:40:11,847
I'm not Dennis.

515
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:14,091
Have you both taken charge now?

516
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:16,737
Please believe me, I'm Barry.

517
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,200
You must forgive me.

518
00:40:25,278 --> 00:40:28,538
My job is to challenge you.

519
00:40:28,615 --> 00:40:30,835
And, as you must know by now,

520
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:34,587
I have plenty of opinions about
how everyone should live their lives.

521
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:38,776
Ask me something about fashion.

522
00:40:38,858 --> 00:40:40,128
I'll prove it.

523
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,720
Look, look, look. Lindt.

524
00:40:45,264 --> 00:40:46,234
Yeah, look.

525
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:50,197
You see? I'm not Dennis.

526
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:53,658
You want me to do something else?

527
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,060
You got ice cream?

528
00:40:55,141 --> 00:40:59,571
Oh, this shirt's a cotton blend anyway
and the collar is from three seasons ago.

529
00:40:59,646 --> 00:41:01,576
Snood? I mean, come on.

530
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,060
Jai, what health-conscious
fast food purveyor

531
00:41:23,136 --> 00:41:25,286
did you originally solicit
to buy these chicken wings

532
00:41:25,371 --> 00:41:28,731
you've so lovingly reheated
in a minor suicidal gesture?

533
00:41:28,808 --> 00:41:30,758
Hooters. And you can't just
throw them out, Dr. Fletcher.

534
00:41:30,844 --> 00:41:32,904
Oh, this is wrong on so many levels.

535
00:41:32,979 --> 00:41:37,239
We finished about 3:15,
so look around 3:18.

536
00:41:37,316 --> 00:41:39,706
You're getting a little soft
around the middle, Jai.

537
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:44,080
The authors of Hooters play
on our incessant need for fat

538
00:41:44,157 --> 00:41:48,047
and man's incessant need to be in
the proximity of augmented breasts.

539
00:41:48,127 --> 00:41:51,717
It's like Henry V ran a fast food franchise.

540
00:41:51,798 --> 00:41:52,888
It's a good place, Dr. Fletcher.

541
00:41:52,966 --> 00:41:54,196
Right.

542
00:41:55,802 --> 00:41:57,762
How'd you know the trash would be spilled?

543
00:41:57,837 --> 00:41:59,187
How can I say this, Jai?

544
00:41:59,272 --> 00:42:01,842
You're not the most meticulous of people.

545
00:42:18,858 --> 00:42:19,978
This guy isn't very neat, is he?

546
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:20,979
He walked right through the trash.

547
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,320
No, Jai.

548
00:42:22,395 --> 00:42:24,715
Any normal person
would have walked around it.

549
00:42:24,798 --> 00:42:26,868
That was an act.

550
00:42:28,134 --> 00:42:30,244
What are you up to, Dennis?

551
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:35,140
Or is it Patricia who's deciding things?

552
00:42:37,744 --> 00:42:39,154
We're not gonna die.

553
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:42,179
Bad things happen.

554
00:42:43,382 --> 00:42:45,222
But not like this.

555
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,319
Casey...

556
00:42:48,922 --> 00:42:50,222
Talk to me.

557
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:56,082
We need to get to a window
or a door, or something.

558
00:42:56,162 --> 00:42:57,332
Don't you think?

559
00:43:12,445 --> 00:43:15,765
The thrill, Casey, is about whether you can

560
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:18,919
or can't outsmart this animal.

561
00:43:22,355 --> 00:43:24,975
See, you didn't used to
like to come out here.

562
00:43:25,058 --> 00:43:27,188
This is like our family tradition, right?

563
00:43:28,762 --> 00:43:29,932
Good shot, big brother.

564
00:43:30,797 --> 00:43:32,127
Thank you, John.

565
00:43:39,906 --> 00:43:42,076
I have your meal, sleepyhead.

566
00:43:47,146 --> 00:43:48,306
Eat.

567
00:43:55,288 --> 00:43:56,358
It's good?

568
00:43:57,957 --> 00:44:00,157
It's got paprika in it.

569
00:44:03,529 --> 00:44:05,329
I'm sorry.

570
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,940
I think I'll put a pretty
flower in your hair.

571
00:44:13,406 --> 00:44:14,406
There we are.

572
00:44:22,215 --> 00:44:24,275
That's to show how important you are.

573
00:44:25,351 --> 00:44:26,441
Come along.

574
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:28,349
We'll have a proper meal.

575
00:44:32,191 --> 00:44:33,411
I understand.

576
00:44:33,492 --> 00:44:36,122
This must all seem so unsatisfactory for you.

577
00:44:36,195 --> 00:44:39,115
But we are doing the best we can.

578
00:44:58,551 --> 00:44:59,521
Good?

579
00:45:02,856 --> 00:45:03,956
Hmm?

580
00:45:06,525 --> 00:45:08,205
Can Claire come eat with us?

581
00:45:08,294 --> 00:45:10,224
No.

582
00:45:10,296 --> 00:45:12,886
No, I'm afraid that can't happen.

583
00:45:12,966 --> 00:45:16,366
She almost ruined our big reception.

584
00:45:17,904 --> 00:45:19,074
Mmm...

585
00:45:23,076 --> 00:45:26,146
I've heard that Asian people's
music aids digestion.

586
00:45:28,281 --> 00:45:30,381
I'll make you a second sandwich.

587
00:45:34,921 --> 00:45:36,941
Do you know,

588
00:45:37,023 --> 00:45:41,563
a family of lions can eat 35 pounds a day?

589
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:48,520
A buck can lose 30% of its
weight during mating season,

590
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:50,221
chasing does around.

591
00:45:50,303 --> 00:45:51,943
They're crepuscular, right?

592
00:45:53,439 --> 00:45:56,359
It means they travel around
during dusk and dawn.

593
00:45:56,442 --> 00:45:57,442
Good for you.

594
00:46:14,027 --> 00:46:15,357
It's crooked.

595
00:46:16,662 --> 00:46:18,032
Forgive me.

596
00:46:28,341 --> 00:46:32,481
I don't know if you know,
but tigers have only 30 teeth.

597
00:46:34,613 --> 00:46:38,103
That's 12 less than a dog.

598
00:46:38,184 --> 00:46:39,994
I thought that was a fun fact.

599
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:41,519
No.

600
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:47,559
Marcia.

601
00:46:48,161 --> 00:46:49,561
Marcia, listen to me.

602
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,940
Go to your room. Shut the door.

603
00:47:16,022 --> 00:47:16,922
Do it now.

604
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:56,395
"In the sun, we will find our passion.

605
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:02,270
"In the sun, we will find our purpose."

606
00:48:08,474 --> 00:48:10,504
You've always been protected.

607
00:48:10,576 --> 00:48:12,996
You've never truly suffered.

608
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:16,099
And that's why we chose you.

609
00:48:16,182 --> 00:48:17,982
You've always been asleep.

610
00:48:21,587 --> 00:48:23,657
You never had a chance.

611
00:48:28,461 --> 00:48:30,431
You never had a chance.

612
00:48:32,198 --> 00:48:35,518
The dark-haired girl, she's gonna
be kept in another closet.

613
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:36,941
You might as well know at this point.

614
00:48:37,636 --> 00:48:39,386
The Beast,

615
00:48:39,472 --> 00:48:42,232
he's coming for you.

616
00:48:42,308 --> 00:48:44,708
All three of you, you're
gonna be kept separate.

617
00:48:46,379 --> 00:48:48,429
You've got...

618
00:48:48,514 --> 00:48:50,454
You've got a crumb on your shirt.

619
00:48:52,818 --> 00:48:54,288
Please take it off.

620
00:48:54,787 --> 00:48:55,587
Just...

621
00:48:57,823 --> 00:48:59,233
Just take it off.

622
00:49:15,774 --> 00:49:16,584
Hey.

623
00:49:22,815 --> 00:49:25,315
Ah.

624
00:49:50,476 --> 00:49:52,846
It wasn't nice, what you
said about Miss Patricia.

625
00:49:54,147 --> 00:49:55,447
You lied.

626
00:50:00,186 --> 00:50:03,076
I'm sorry about that, Hedwig.

627
00:50:03,156 --> 00:50:07,326
You guys lied to me,
made me scared, etcetera.

628
00:50:10,829 --> 00:50:14,119
Mr. Dennis, he says
you wear a lot of shirts.

629
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,370
I like this shirt.

630
00:50:16,302 --> 00:50:17,822
Thank you.

631
00:50:17,903 --> 00:50:20,463
Do you know who Dennis and Miss Patricia are?

632
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:21,839
No.

633
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:28,430
Every one of us has to wait in a chair,

634
00:50:28,514 --> 00:50:32,774
and Barry, he decides
who stands in the light.

635
00:50:32,851 --> 00:50:35,521
But Barry lost that power because of me.

636
00:50:37,456 --> 00:50:40,726
I can wish myself into
the light anytime I want.

637
00:50:41,527 --> 00:50:45,147
It's a special power.

638
00:50:45,231 --> 00:50:48,431
Barry just has to keep sitting
in his chair if I want him to.

639
00:50:50,303 --> 00:50:53,243
That's why Dennis and Miss Patricia
said I could be with them.

640
00:50:54,607 --> 00:50:58,127
Dennis and Miss Patricia,
they believe in The Beast

641
00:50:58,211 --> 00:50:59,751
and what he can do.

642
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,577
Have you seen him?

643
00:51:07,286 --> 00:51:08,586
The Beast?

644
00:51:10,223 --> 00:51:11,763
No. Can I kiss you?

645
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:16,759
I wanted to kiss the other girl with
the dark hair, but she's in trouble.

646
00:51:20,899 --> 00:51:22,259
So, do you want to?

647
00:51:22,335 --> 00:51:23,785
I mean, I don't know
much about kissing, though.

648
00:51:23,869 --> 00:51:24,669
Yeah.

649
00:51:28,374 --> 00:51:29,714
Okay.

650
00:51:30,476 --> 00:51:32,266
Uh...

651
00:51:32,345 --> 00:51:33,675
Okay, here we go.

652
00:51:36,315 --> 00:51:37,365
One...

653
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:38,450
Two...

654
00:51:39,485 --> 00:51:40,485
Three.

655
00:51:55,968 --> 00:51:57,598
You might be pregnant now.

656
00:52:00,306 --> 00:52:01,636
Am I a good kisser?

657
00:52:02,741 --> 00:52:03,741
Yeah.

658
00:52:04,343 --> 00:52:05,433
I like dancing.

659
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:07,571
Do you like dancing?

660
00:52:07,646 --> 00:52:11,436
I like dancing to my CD player in my room.

661
00:52:11,517 --> 00:52:13,317
Kanye West is my main man.

662
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,380
We got my CD player set up in my room,

663
00:52:17,456 --> 00:52:18,786
right next to my window.

664
00:52:19,592 --> 00:52:20,592
I'm like...

665
00:52:27,733 --> 00:52:28,733
We gots the moves.

666
00:52:29,034 --> 00:52:29,844
Wow.

667
00:52:32,471 --> 00:52:35,691
Maybe I could watch you dance

668
00:52:35,774 --> 00:52:38,444
and listen to music with you.

669
00:52:39,712 --> 00:52:41,782
No, my music's in my room.

670
00:52:42,348 --> 00:52:43,818
Oh. Right.

671
00:52:46,552 --> 00:52:47,552
Maybe

672
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:49,987
you could sneak me there.

673
00:52:51,657 --> 00:52:53,587
Are you trying to trick me?

674
00:52:54,327 --> 00:52:55,687
Etcetera?

675
00:52:56,829 --> 00:52:58,649
I'll tell on you.

676
00:52:58,731 --> 00:53:00,251
I'm telling on you.

677
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:02,423
I'll tell you something.

678
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:04,661
And you can tell me
if I'm lying or not, okay?

679
00:53:04,737 --> 00:53:06,637
- Mmm-hmm.
- Like a test. Okay?

680
00:53:12,077 --> 00:53:16,877
I get into trouble at school, on purpose.

681
00:53:21,354 --> 00:53:23,664
So I can get sent to detention.

682
00:53:28,427 --> 00:53:31,857
To get away from everyone.

683
00:53:38,571 --> 00:53:40,411
So that I can be alone.

684
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:54,850
Okay, I'll show you
something cool in my room.

685
00:53:55,954 --> 00:53:57,184
Okay.

686
00:53:57,255 --> 00:54:00,655
But after Mr. Dennis has finished
his getting-ready ritual.

687
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,720
I have to go.

688
00:54:02,795 --> 00:54:04,515
He's got an appointment.

689
00:54:04,597 --> 00:54:07,417
When I fall asleep, one of the others
keeps trying to reach the doctor lady

690
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,320
to tell on us.

691
00:54:09,402 --> 00:54:11,722
That pant, it's got a red lining.

692
00:54:11,804 --> 00:54:15,094
You can see it in
the long slit down the side.

693
00:54:15,173 --> 00:54:19,773
We have been talking about
silk-and-wool blend for 20 minutes.

694
00:54:19,845 --> 00:54:22,765
Can I guess that you emailed
me in the middle of the night

695
00:54:22,848 --> 00:54:28,038
for an emergency session
due to garden-variety issues?

696
00:54:30,656 --> 00:54:35,106
I was down and I emailed you and
I woke up and I feel better.

697
00:54:35,193 --> 00:54:36,933
I feel better.

698
00:54:39,131 --> 00:54:40,721
I had a thought.

699
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,019
Mmm-mmm.

700
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,820
I want to talk about the incident at work.

701
00:54:44,903 --> 00:54:46,533
It's okay, Barry.

702
00:54:46,605 --> 00:54:48,385
You're safe.

703
00:54:48,474 --> 00:54:50,834
I just want to bring the details back.

704
00:54:50,909 --> 00:54:52,949
We'll just talk about the details.

705
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,740
A high school from Camden, New Jersey

706
00:54:57,816 --> 00:55:00,906
was on a field trip at your place of work

707
00:55:00,986 --> 00:55:03,536
and two young ladies came up to you.

708
00:55:03,622 --> 00:55:06,482
And one took your hand

709
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,779
and put it under her shirt on her breast
and the second one did the same

710
00:55:09,862 --> 00:55:12,892
and then they just ran off
laughing to their friends.

711
00:55:12,965 --> 00:55:15,615
You surmised that it might be on a dare.

712
00:55:15,701 --> 00:55:18,061
You said they were 17 or 18.

713
00:55:18,136 --> 00:55:20,086
You said it upset you for days.

714
00:55:20,172 --> 00:55:23,182
It was just a teenage prank.
I get that now.

715
00:55:24,577 --> 00:55:27,527
And see, that's my mistake.

716
00:55:27,613 --> 00:55:31,943
I believe that I went over this
incident with you too fast.

717
00:55:32,017 --> 00:55:34,807
Although you said you were fine,

718
00:55:34,887 --> 00:55:38,937
and the other identities
I met with said it was fine,

719
00:55:39,024 --> 00:55:43,184
I believe that this brought up issues

720
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:46,121
from when you were a child and abused.

721
00:55:46,198 --> 00:55:49,118
Sometimes another incident of abuse

722
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:51,901
can cause suppressed
personalities to take the light.

723
00:55:52,705 --> 00:55:55,655
Dennis, if this is you,

724
00:55:55,741 --> 00:55:58,061
I completely understand

725
00:55:58,143 --> 00:56:02,103
why you felt the need to take
over and protect the others.

726
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,470
Please!

727
00:56:03,549 --> 00:56:04,999
Doctor, not this again.

728
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:06,243
The others told me

729
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:10,778
that you and Patricia told
the group about this Beast.

730
00:56:10,856 --> 00:56:14,176
And I told them that these
are just scary stories

731
00:56:14,259 --> 00:56:18,719
that Dennis and Patricia tell
the others to scare them.

732
00:56:18,797 --> 00:56:21,517
How this Beast can crawl on walls,

733
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:25,890
like the best rock climbers using
the slightest friction and imperfections

734
00:56:25,971 --> 00:56:30,701
to hold his body close
to seemingly sheer surfaces.

735
00:56:30,776 --> 00:56:34,976
How his skin is thick and tough
like the hide of a rhinoceros.

736
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:41,890
Do you really believe
the stories about The Beast?

737
00:56:43,589 --> 00:56:44,609
Hmm.

738
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:46,860
If this is you, Dennis,

739
00:56:48,093 --> 00:56:50,703
I understand why Kevin needs you.

740
00:56:52,565 --> 00:56:54,985
You are strong and disciplined.

741
00:56:55,067 --> 00:56:59,167
You are precise and you
will not be taken advantage of.

742
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:02,939
You can trust me.

743
00:57:04,777 --> 00:57:06,157
For example,

744
00:57:06,244 --> 00:57:10,704
I do have the ability to use Kevin's
full name and bring him forward

745
00:57:10,783 --> 00:57:12,053
as he has in the past.

746
00:57:13,151 --> 00:57:15,671
But I wouldn't do that.

747
00:57:15,754 --> 00:57:19,914
I know that that would
be chaos for all of you.

748
00:57:19,992 --> 00:57:21,912
Everyone would grab the light.

749
00:57:21,994 --> 00:57:24,104
I don't want to hurt any of you that way.

750
00:57:25,998 --> 00:57:27,798
You don't have to hide.

751
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:32,067
I know you are someone who cares for Kevin.

752
00:57:34,807 --> 00:57:38,107
You are not evil to me.

753
00:57:40,646 --> 00:57:42,846
You were necessary.

754
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,220
Dennis.

755
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,220
Is that you?

756
00:58:04,369 --> 00:58:06,239
They keep calling us The Horde.

757
00:58:08,941 --> 00:58:10,311
The others, you know?

758
00:58:12,244 --> 00:58:15,354
Miss Patricia and I, we are ridiculed.

759
00:58:17,149 --> 00:58:21,289
Now, we're not perfect, but we
don't deserve to be ridiculed.

760
00:58:23,221 --> 00:58:26,161
We're all struggling.
They have to admit that.

761
00:58:31,764 --> 00:58:34,104
I am pleased to meet you, Dennis.

762
00:58:36,301 --> 00:58:37,801
You, too.

763
00:58:40,806 --> 00:58:45,126
I assume you don't know who emailed
me for the emergency sessions?

764
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:46,710
One of the others.

765
00:58:48,313 --> 00:58:49,603
Are you in charge?

766
00:58:49,682 --> 00:58:51,802
Yeah, we've taken charge.

767
00:58:51,884 --> 00:58:54,074
We're the only ones that can protect Kevin.

768
00:58:54,152 --> 00:58:56,152
We're all here to protect Kevin.

769
00:58:56,922 --> 00:58:58,222
He's very weak.

770
00:59:01,193 --> 00:59:04,283
He doesn't know how powerful we can be.

771
00:59:04,362 --> 00:59:07,032
Would you mind telling me when
you first came into existence?

772
00:59:11,103 --> 00:59:16,173
And how you and Patricia, the other
undesirable identity, became aligned?

773
00:59:19,778 --> 00:59:20,878
That's okay.

774
00:59:21,446 --> 00:59:23,246
Do you still have strong beliefs?

775
00:59:24,249 --> 00:59:26,099
That depends on what.

776
00:59:26,184 --> 00:59:29,424
This story of The Beast.

777
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:39,150
One thing, Dennis, that may
comfort you if you are confused

778
00:59:39,231 --> 00:59:43,091
is that you've met the other alters.

779
00:59:43,168 --> 00:59:45,798
You're all in a room in chairs, right?

780
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:48,159
Yeah.

781
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,260
But you never met The Beast.

782
00:59:50,342 --> 00:59:52,872
Because he doesn't reside
with the rest of you.

783
00:59:52,945 --> 00:59:56,095
Because he resides in the
train yard, as the story goes,

784
00:59:56,181 --> 00:59:58,301
because Kevin's dad left on a train.

785
00:59:58,383 --> 01:00:03,293
But the fact is, you and Patricia
have never met The Beast.

786
01:00:03,922 --> 01:00:04,922
Have you?

787
01:00:06,324 --> 01:00:07,234
No.

788
01:00:08,393 --> 01:00:10,363
That's because he's not an alter.

789
01:00:11,797 --> 01:00:13,997
He's not the 24th identity.

790
01:00:15,934 --> 01:00:17,244
He's a fantasy.

791
01:00:36,955 --> 01:00:39,205
Hurry up! Let's go!

792
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:41,031
Come on, it's time.

793
01:02:07,545 --> 01:02:08,375
Wow.

794
01:02:09,214 --> 01:02:10,384
I know.

795
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,870
This is your CD player?

796
01:02:13,952 --> 01:02:15,122
Yeah.

797
01:02:18,456 --> 01:02:19,816
You don't like it?

798
01:02:21,426 --> 01:02:22,526
- It's not new...
- No!

799
01:02:23,461 --> 01:02:25,101
No, I'm just, uh...

800
01:02:27,299 --> 01:02:29,419
I'm confused.

801
01:02:29,501 --> 01:02:31,091
You said it was near a window.

802
01:02:31,169 --> 01:02:32,469
Oh, that's here!

803
01:02:34,472 --> 01:02:35,962
Watch.

804
01:02:36,041 --> 01:02:37,181
Now, it's closed.

805
01:02:38,443 --> 01:02:39,543
Now, it's open.

806
01:02:41,113 --> 01:02:42,113
Now, it's closed.

807
01:02:43,982 --> 01:02:45,122
Now, it's open.

808
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:56,589
Did you think it was a real window?

809
01:03:00,065 --> 01:03:03,035
So you could leave, etcetera?

810
01:03:05,537 --> 01:03:08,607
Help me get out of here, Hedwig.

811
01:03:10,508 --> 01:03:13,648
Just get me the keys and let me out the door.

812
01:03:14,546 --> 01:03:15,726
Please.

813
01:03:15,813 --> 01:03:20,243
Miss Patricia says that nobody will make fun
of me anymore when The Beast comes!

814
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:22,938
She says that everyone
will see how amazing I am

815
01:03:23,021 --> 01:03:26,141
and then all of the silly mistakes,
they won't matter anymore.

816
01:03:26,224 --> 01:03:28,154
I think you should go
back to your room. No!

817
01:03:28,226 --> 01:03:30,946
Wait, please, I wanna hear
your Kanye West albums.

818
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:32,419
Show me your room.

819
01:03:32,497 --> 01:03:34,587
Let's stay here.
I'm sorry I asked to leave.

820
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:36,246
I can't.

821
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:37,664
You said you wanted to show
me something cool, right?

822
01:03:37,735 --> 01:03:38,585
No.

823
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:41,070
- Show me something. Please!
- I don't want to.

824
01:03:44,242 --> 01:03:45,242
This!

825
01:03:53,018 --> 01:03:54,488
Wow.

826
01:03:55,553 --> 01:03:56,923
It's nice.

827
01:03:57,489 --> 01:03:59,489
It's not a toy.

828
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:06,180
This is real?

829
01:04:06,264 --> 01:04:07,274
Yes!

830
01:04:09,367 --> 01:04:11,097
It's Mr. Dennis'.

831
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:14,440
He doesn't even know I stole it.

832
01:04:16,308 --> 01:04:18,438
Pretty cool, right?

833
01:04:20,445 --> 01:04:23,715
You can listen to people talking
and they don't even know you're listening.

834
01:04:26,418 --> 01:04:28,108
Who does this talk to?

835
01:04:28,186 --> 01:04:29,316
Don't touch that.

836
01:04:30,555 --> 01:04:32,355
I just wanna see if it works.

837
01:04:34,192 --> 01:04:35,952
Hey, what are you doing?

838
01:04:36,028 --> 01:04:37,448
Don't touch those buttons.
You're gonna get us found out.

839
01:04:37,529 --> 01:04:39,399
- Yeah, East gate here.
- What up?

840
01:04:44,336 --> 01:04:45,566
Don't talk.

841
01:04:46,604 --> 01:04:48,244
- What up?
- Don't talk.

842
01:04:51,376 --> 01:04:52,356
Hello?

843
01:04:52,444 --> 01:04:53,474
I'm gonna slap you!

844
01:04:53,545 --> 01:04:54,575
Who's this?

845
01:04:57,315 --> 01:04:59,735
Hello. Hello, my name is Casey Cooke.

846
01:04:59,817 --> 01:05:02,147
I'm being held in a basement.
I've been abducted with two other girls.

847
01:05:03,555 --> 01:05:06,285
Who the hell is this?

848
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:16,129
Hello?

849
01:05:16,601 --> 01:05:18,321
Casey Cooke.

850
01:05:18,403 --> 01:05:19,493
I've been abducted.

851
01:05:19,571 --> 01:05:22,061
You need to find me.

852
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:23,530
Betty, is that you?

853
01:05:23,608 --> 01:05:24,998
This isn't funny.

854
01:05:25,077 --> 01:05:27,497
Call the police. I must be near you.

855
01:05:27,579 --> 01:05:30,269
I'm being held in a basement or something.

856
01:05:30,348 --> 01:05:31,668
Okay, Betty, listen.

857
01:05:31,749 --> 01:05:33,639
Tell Larry and Fish I said hi.

858
01:05:33,718 --> 01:05:36,168
Tell him I still got his orange headphones.

859
01:05:36,254 --> 01:05:38,064
I don't know where I am.

860
01:05:38,656 --> 01:05:40,206
There's a man here.

861
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:42,562
He abducted us and he's going to kill me.

862
01:05:52,437 --> 01:05:54,607
I only have a few hours left.

863
01:05:59,111 --> 01:06:00,081
Please.

864
01:06:01,646 --> 01:06:03,276
I'm begging you.

865
01:06:04,582 --> 01:06:07,142
Somebody save us.

866
01:06:07,219 --> 01:06:09,069
Wait, who is this?

867
01:06:09,154 --> 01:06:11,664
And how did you get one of our walkies?

868
01:06:19,631 --> 01:06:21,831
Put your hands together in contrition.

869
01:06:24,169 --> 01:06:28,109
"In the sun, we will find our passion.

870
01:06:29,607 --> 01:06:31,597
"In the sun,

871
01:06:31,676 --> 01:06:36,606
"we will find our purpose."

872
01:06:46,891 --> 01:06:51,121
I read that on a sympathy
card in a supermarket.

873
01:06:51,196 --> 01:06:54,626
It was for funerals, but
I thought it was beautiful.

874
01:06:59,904 --> 01:07:03,784
Dennis will explain the
meaning of this evening.

875
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:41,795
The Beast is a sentient creature

876
01:07:41,879 --> 01:07:45,669
who represents the highest
form of humans' evolution.

877
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:49,590
He believes the time of
ordinary humanity is over.

878
01:07:51,589 --> 01:07:53,689
I hope this makes you feel calm.

879
01:07:55,593 --> 01:08:00,923
You will be in the presence
of something greater.

880
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:03,488
I was gonna ask for your last shirt,

881
01:08:03,568 --> 01:08:05,658
but I won't.

882
01:08:05,737 --> 01:08:07,707
Because tonight is a sacred night.

883
01:08:09,341 --> 01:08:10,911
It's almost over.

884
01:08:19,016 --> 01:08:20,716
Casey. Come on.

885
01:08:22,254 --> 01:08:24,194
Let's pretend we're animals again.

886
01:08:24,556 --> 01:08:25,716
Come on.

887
01:08:28,793 --> 01:08:30,703
Casey, come on. This is our game.

888
01:08:33,331 --> 01:08:35,471
I'll tell your dad you're not being nice.

889
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:57,840
Come on, take off your stuff.

890
01:08:57,922 --> 01:08:59,912
Animals don't wear clothes.

891
01:08:59,991 --> 01:09:01,281
Come on.

892
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:02,759
Yeah, yeah.

893
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:04,260
Come on.

894
01:09:29,521 --> 01:09:30,991
Hey, Casey bear.

895
01:09:34,526 --> 01:09:35,886
This isn't funny.

896
01:09:40,332 --> 01:09:41,802
Is it loaded?

897
01:09:44,636 --> 01:09:45,866
Casey.

898
01:09:47,739 --> 01:09:48,769
I'm your uncle.

899
01:09:52,344 --> 01:09:53,854
Stop it, Casey.

900
01:09:55,413 --> 01:09:57,273
Put that gun down.

901
01:09:57,349 --> 01:09:58,899
I'm getting upset.

902
01:09:58,983 --> 01:10:00,773
I'm about to get very angry.

903
01:10:00,852 --> 01:10:01,892
Give me the gun!

904
01:10:09,627 --> 01:10:10,957
Could have killed me.

905
01:11:19,063 --> 01:11:20,723
This place is closed. You can't get in.

906
01:11:20,798 --> 01:11:22,728
No, it's okay.

907
01:11:29,173 --> 01:11:31,533
Hello, Dennis.

908
01:11:31,609 --> 01:11:34,729
One of the others emailed me just now.

909
01:11:34,812 --> 01:11:36,872
Is everything okay?

910
01:11:36,948 --> 01:11:38,048
We're fine.

911
01:11:38,683 --> 01:11:40,043
Dennis,

912
01:11:40,117 --> 01:11:42,637
Kevin is really lucky to have you.

913
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:45,410
You are quite extraordinary.

914
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:47,690
I just don't want you guys to get hurt.

915
01:11:53,798 --> 01:11:56,428
You think we're extraordinary?

916
01:11:57,034 --> 01:11:58,904
I like you, Dennis.

917
01:11:59,737 --> 01:12:01,457
May I come in?

918
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:03,039
And can we talk?

919
01:12:05,142 --> 01:12:07,812
I know you wanna tell me something.

920
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,120
Why don't you just tell me?

921
01:12:26,664 --> 01:12:28,894
We're very similar, you and I.

922
01:12:28,966 --> 01:12:30,916
Both on the outside, looking in.

923
01:12:31,002 --> 01:12:32,672
Please, sit.

924
01:12:33,538 --> 01:12:36,088
I don't get many visitors.

925
01:12:36,173 --> 01:12:38,103
Uh, I'll get you some water.

926
01:12:38,175 --> 01:12:40,495
They got a proper quarters for me

927
01:12:40,578 --> 01:12:44,698
in a building on the south side,
but we prefer it here.

928
01:12:44,782 --> 01:12:47,452
When they promoted me to head of
maintenance, they said I could have it.

929
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,790
Who are you going to meet?

930
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:58,030
I wanna talk about

931
01:12:59,531 --> 01:13:00,701
Kevin

932
01:13:02,834 --> 01:13:05,104
and what his mother did to him.

933
01:13:06,704 --> 01:13:08,894
I remember it all.

934
01:13:08,973 --> 01:13:12,063
I'm happy you're suddenly so open.

935
01:13:12,143 --> 01:13:14,733
Kevin's mother had rather malevolent ways

936
01:13:14,812 --> 01:13:17,572
of punishing a three-year-old.

937
01:13:17,649 --> 01:13:19,239
Is that when you arrived in the light?

938
01:13:19,316 --> 01:13:20,176
Yeah.

939
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:25,607
The one way to avoid her attention
was to keep everything spotless,

940
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:27,990
everything perfect.

941
01:13:30,595 --> 01:13:33,145
I know you're coming from
good intentions, Dennis,

942
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:36,020
but there are other ways to help Kevin now.

943
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:41,090
I've lost so many patients into the system.

944
01:13:41,172 --> 01:13:44,962
I want you to know, Dennis,
I will never stop fighting for you.

945
01:13:45,042 --> 01:13:48,802
My patients have become my family.

946
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,170
They are what I've chosen instead
of a more traditional path.

947
01:13:52,249 --> 01:13:55,839
I hope you feel you can
be truly honest with me.

948
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,290
I actually wanna be honest with you.

949
01:14:00,057 --> 01:14:02,607
I lied before.

950
01:14:02,694 --> 01:14:05,304
When you asked if I'd ever met The Beast,

951
01:14:06,197 --> 01:14:08,087
I said no.

952
01:14:08,165 --> 01:14:09,525
That really isn't true.

953
01:14:13,104 --> 01:14:18,804
You wrote about a woman in Germany
who'd been blind for 10 years.

954
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:22,296
And then, it was discovered that she had DID.

955
01:14:22,379 --> 01:14:26,669
Then three of her identities developed sight.

956
01:14:26,751 --> 01:14:31,111
And you speculated that her
optical nerves regenerated

957
01:14:31,188 --> 01:14:33,978
because of her beliefs.

958
01:14:34,058 --> 01:14:36,078
What are you trying to say?

959
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:40,820
There are things, Dr. Fletcher,
that all of us would find hard to believe.

960
01:14:40,898 --> 01:14:43,888
Are you trying to tell me
there's a 24th identity?

961
01:14:43,968 --> 01:14:46,318
You protect the broken.

962
01:14:46,403 --> 01:14:50,063
When you said that you thought
this situation was extraordinary,

963
01:14:50,141 --> 01:14:52,601
I knew you can maybe understand.

964
01:14:52,677 --> 01:14:53,997
Understand what?

965
01:14:54,078 --> 01:14:55,078
The Beast

966
01:14:56,881 --> 01:14:58,351
is real.

967
01:14:59,651 --> 01:15:01,241
He's just emerged.

968
01:15:01,318 --> 01:15:03,758
You were right about everything.

969
01:15:04,956 --> 01:15:06,186
What does he look like?

970
01:15:08,259 --> 01:15:10,879
He's much bigger than I am

971
01:15:10,962 --> 01:15:12,962
and I'm the biggest of all of us.

972
01:15:13,931 --> 01:15:15,621
He's tall.

973
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:18,020
He's very muscular.

974
01:15:18,102 --> 01:15:20,662
And he's got a long mane of hair

975
01:15:20,738 --> 01:15:24,938
and his fingers are twice the length of ours.

976
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:29,600
He believes we are extraordinary.

977
01:15:29,681 --> 01:15:33,951
That we don't represent
a mistake, but our potential.

978
01:15:36,888 --> 01:15:38,788
You say the same things.

979
01:15:41,358 --> 01:15:43,258
He's on the move.

980
01:15:43,861 --> 01:15:45,301
What does that mean?

981
01:15:46,731 --> 01:15:48,201
I don't understand.

982
01:15:49,366 --> 01:15:51,166
He can't be real.

983
01:15:52,904 --> 01:15:56,674
There must be limits to what
a human being can become.

984
01:15:58,375 --> 01:15:59,795
And there's another whole part

985
01:15:59,877 --> 01:16:02,197
of the story, isn't there?

986
01:16:02,279 --> 01:16:05,839
About the eating of the impure young?

987
01:16:05,917 --> 01:16:08,637
What does impure even mean?

988
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:09,940
Well...

989
01:16:10,021 --> 01:16:11,111
We should discuss that

990
01:16:11,188 --> 01:16:13,278
so that you can understand fully.

991
01:16:13,357 --> 01:16:14,947
Understand what?

992
01:16:15,026 --> 01:16:16,756
Sometimes,

993
01:16:18,062 --> 01:16:20,032
there's just no other way.

994
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,270
Who are you going to meet?

995
01:16:27,438 --> 01:16:29,008
Him.

996
01:16:34,278 --> 01:16:35,168
You know what?

997
01:16:35,246 --> 01:16:37,876
I would love to take notes on all of this.

998
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:42,436
We should probably discuss this
in a proper session tomorrow.

999
01:16:42,519 --> 01:16:44,109
Really?

1000
01:16:44,188 --> 01:16:46,008
You're okay with this?

1001
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:49,750
This has been so wonderful,
you being so open.

1002
01:16:49,827 --> 01:16:53,787
I can see that you feel very empowered
by the philosophies of The Beast.

1003
01:16:53,865 --> 01:16:55,845
I'm going to go now.

1004
01:16:55,933 --> 01:16:58,373
I knew you would understand. I'll see you.

1005
01:17:11,983 --> 01:17:13,853
Would you mind

1006
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,190
if I used your bathroom?

1007
01:17:19,991 --> 01:17:20,991
No.

1008
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:26,399
It's down the hall, near
the stairs, on your left.

1009
01:17:30,868 --> 01:17:32,238
How we doing?

1010
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:34,410
I'm okay.

1011
01:18:14,211 --> 01:18:15,551
Are you real?

1012
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:20,820
Who is it?

1013
01:18:21,252 --> 01:18:22,422
Help me.

1014
01:18:24,088 --> 01:18:25,138
Help me.

1015
01:18:25,222 --> 01:18:26,892
Is someone there?

1016
01:18:29,393 --> 01:18:31,303
Please help me.

1017
01:18:33,931 --> 01:18:36,021
They will never reach their potential.

1018
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:37,420
They don't really matter.

1019
01:18:37,501 --> 01:18:39,401
Listen to me, Dennis.

1020
01:18:40,104 --> 01:18:42,864
I should've listened better.

1021
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:47,800
I should've understood what you're
capable of, how powerful you are.

1022
01:18:47,879 --> 01:18:50,099
Patricia says your way isn't working.

1023
01:18:50,181 --> 01:18:52,271
The world will understand now.

1024
01:18:52,349 --> 01:18:56,189
Dennis, this is an egregious wrong.

1025
01:18:58,222 --> 01:18:59,942
These young women are suffering.

1026
01:19:00,024 --> 01:19:01,814
This is a crime.

1027
01:19:01,893 --> 01:19:04,123
I can't let you keep them here.

1028
01:19:04,195 --> 01:19:05,975
We've gotta stop this.

1029
01:19:06,063 --> 01:19:08,293
This identity is monstrous.

1030
01:19:08,365 --> 01:19:10,045
I'm really sad you feel this way.

1031
01:19:10,134 --> 01:19:11,824
Can't you see?

1032
01:19:11,903 --> 01:19:14,893
He is formed because of
your time in this place.

1033
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:43,499
There's a lady.

1034
01:19:44,401 --> 01:19:46,101
Someone's here.

1035
01:19:47,939 --> 01:19:49,609
We need to get out of these rooms.

1036
01:19:52,376 --> 01:19:53,556
Is there anything in your room?

1037
01:19:53,644 --> 01:19:55,454
Anything that we could use?

1038
01:20:03,354 --> 01:20:04,994
There's nothing in here.

1039
01:20:07,524 --> 01:20:09,294
There's a hanger.

1040
01:20:33,117 --> 01:20:34,447
Thank you, Dennis.

1041
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,490
Here you go, sir.

1042
01:20:56,207 --> 01:21:00,327
It sounded like there were slide
bolts on the outside of our doors.

1043
01:21:00,411 --> 01:21:02,711
See if you can move the lock
through the crack in the door.

1044
01:22:12,583 --> 01:22:14,313
Stay calm.

1045
01:22:14,385 --> 01:22:16,745
We're getting out of here.
We're gonna get Casey.

1046
01:22:18,389 --> 01:22:20,219
You can do this, Marcia.

1047
01:22:56,193 --> 01:22:59,523
With regard to Chahamana's defeat
and Muhammad of Ghor's conquests

1048
01:22:59,596 --> 01:23:03,086
between 1192 and 1200,

1049
01:23:03,167 --> 01:23:06,717
I would liken it to
Muhammad's brazen ultimatum

1050
01:23:06,803 --> 01:23:09,643
that Prithviraj either apostatize or fight.

1051
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:15,232
Like Prithviraj's defiance,

1052
01:23:15,312 --> 01:23:18,742
we should stand up to The Horde's advances.

1053
01:23:18,815 --> 01:23:22,145
In the face of their scare
tactics, we should show...

1054
01:23:23,687 --> 01:23:25,487
I hate my insulin shots.

1055
01:23:26,790 --> 01:23:28,710
No one else around here has to take them.

1056
01:23:28,792 --> 01:23:30,632
Why do I have to have diabetes?

1057
01:23:32,196 --> 01:23:34,416
All the doctors, besides Dr. Fletcher,

1058
01:23:34,498 --> 01:23:37,418
say that we're the same person.

1059
01:23:37,501 --> 01:23:39,541
Just personalities, huh?

1060
01:23:40,704 --> 01:23:43,214
How do you explain I'm the only one
that needs these, you motherfuck...

1061
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:51,179
I'm wearing cargo pants from the '90s.

1062
01:23:51,948 --> 01:23:54,238
And a scarf.

1063
01:23:54,318 --> 01:23:56,408
If it wasn't for the
Varvatos T-shirt underneath,

1064
01:23:56,487 --> 01:23:58,117
I'd be a mess.

1065
01:23:59,356 --> 01:24:01,116
I got no taste for things right now.

1066
01:24:02,259 --> 01:24:05,459
I'm worried sick.

1067
01:24:06,863 --> 01:24:10,353
I have a very bad feeling
that I'm losing time.

1068
01:24:10,434 --> 01:24:11,894
I decide who gets the light, right?

1069
01:24:11,968 --> 01:24:13,488
I think

1070
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:17,490
someone is stealing the light
from me when I'm not aware.

1071
01:24:17,574 --> 01:24:21,834
The Horde keeps obsessing about
the ones who haven't suffered.

1072
01:24:21,912 --> 01:24:26,152
I don't know where they're going
with this, but it scares me.

1073
01:25:27,311 --> 01:25:29,551
Picture yourself in a couple hours at home.

1074
01:25:30,281 --> 01:25:31,751
On the couch,

1075
01:25:32,849 --> 01:25:35,289
in that ugly-ass sweatshirt that you love.

1076
01:25:46,397 --> 01:25:48,887
It's an animal!

1077
01:25:48,965 --> 01:25:51,565
He goes like this if there's
a coyote or something.

1078
01:27:31,735 --> 01:27:33,635
Kevin, Kevin.

1079
01:28:02,098 --> 01:28:03,928
Thank you

1080
01:28:05,436 --> 01:28:07,596
for helping us till now.

1081
01:29:14,004 --> 01:29:17,694
I guess I should tell
Dr. Fletcher about this...

1082
01:29:17,774 --> 01:29:19,434
but she'll worry.

1083
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:20,810
She's such a sweet woman.

1084
01:29:22,879 --> 01:29:26,799
I believe I will go for a nice walk

1085
01:29:26,883 --> 01:29:30,123
and think this through organizationally.

1086
01:29:33,123 --> 01:29:37,513
Thus ends my journal for Monday.

1087
01:29:37,594 --> 01:29:38,604
Ciao.

1088
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:01,110
Claire.

1089
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,220
Marcia.

1090
01:31:27,904 --> 01:31:29,014
Claire.

1091
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:31,240
Claire, let's go.

1092
01:32:43,213 --> 01:32:45,053
"Kevin Wendell Crumb."

1093
01:33:11,007 --> 01:33:12,907
Kevin Wendell Crumb?

1094
01:33:17,848 --> 01:33:18,938
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1095
01:33:21,885 --> 01:33:24,215
Kevin Wendell Crumb!

1096
01:33:35,265 --> 01:33:37,195
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1097
01:33:38,902 --> 01:33:41,202
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1098
01:33:41,872 --> 01:33:43,742
You made a mess.

1099
01:33:44,808 --> 01:33:46,238
Come out here.

1100
01:33:48,979 --> 01:33:50,769
Kevin Wendell Crumb!

1101
01:33:50,847 --> 01:33:52,367
You made a mess!

1102
01:33:52,448 --> 01:33:53,718
Get out here!

1103
01:34:20,443 --> 01:34:22,773
Who are you?

1104
01:34:22,846 --> 01:34:24,406
What's happening?

1105
01:34:26,482 --> 01:34:28,122
Something horrible.

1106
01:34:30,086 --> 01:34:31,316
What'd I do?

1107
01:34:33,289 --> 01:34:35,029
Did I hurt you?

1108
01:34:43,099 --> 01:34:44,399
Dr. Fletcher.

1109
01:34:45,035 --> 01:34:46,495
Dr. Fletcher.

1110
01:34:48,872 --> 01:34:50,312
Who did that?

1111
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:54,195
You did.

1112
01:34:54,277 --> 01:34:57,327
I swear, I was on a bus.

1113
01:34:57,413 --> 01:34:59,323
I don't remember anything after that. I...

1114
01:35:01,384 --> 01:35:04,354
This is still September 18, 2014, right?

1115
01:35:15,231 --> 01:35:17,131
There's a shotgun I bought.

1116
01:35:18,568 --> 01:35:21,458
It's in the bottom cabinet,
hidden behind things.

1117
01:35:21,537 --> 01:35:24,367
The shells are in my uniform
closet out in the service hall.

1118
01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:28,510
Kill me.

1119
01:35:32,382 --> 01:35:33,522
Then kill me.

1120
01:35:40,190 --> 01:35:41,180
Wait, no!

1121
01:35:41,257 --> 01:35:42,847
Don't do that!

1122
01:35:42,926 --> 01:35:44,386
He can't handle reality.

1123
01:35:45,095 --> 01:35:45,975
My name is Jade.

1124
01:35:46,062 --> 01:35:48,222
Has Dr. Fletcher been getting our emails?

1125
01:35:48,298 --> 01:35:49,588
This is what we have to do.

1126
01:35:50,967 --> 01:35:52,887
As in 1008,

1127
01:35:52,969 --> 01:35:56,889
when Anandapala suffered
the Shahis' most crushing defeat

1128
01:35:56,973 --> 01:36:00,163
and Mahmud overran the entirety
of the Punjab region,

1129
01:36:00,243 --> 01:36:02,873
taking the famed temple of Kangra,

1130
01:36:02,946 --> 01:36:05,996
we have been wronged by this alliance,

1131
01:36:06,082 --> 01:36:09,072
this horde of Patricia, Dennis and the boy.

1132
01:36:09,152 --> 01:36:11,992
Their actions do not represent us.

1133
01:36:12,555 --> 01:36:14,405
They are every...

1134
01:36:14,490 --> 01:36:16,630
Everybody, just take a minute!

1135
01:36:17,393 --> 01:36:20,053
Oh, baby girl.

1136
01:36:20,130 --> 01:36:22,120
They've been stealing control
of the light from me.

1137
01:36:22,198 --> 01:36:24,858
But the group are gonna work through this.

1138
01:36:24,935 --> 01:36:26,955
Honey, my name is Barry.

1139
01:36:36,947 --> 01:36:38,577
You shouldn't have used the walkie-talkie.

1140
01:36:43,086 --> 01:36:44,546
They almost caught us.

1141
01:36:46,589 --> 01:36:48,579
Stop it, Hedwig!

1142
01:36:48,658 --> 01:36:51,948
They were right. Look at you.

1143
01:36:52,028 --> 01:36:53,458
You're so frightened of us.

1144
01:36:55,031 --> 01:36:59,091
Dennis and Miss Patricia
are in charge because of me.

1145
01:36:59,169 --> 01:37:02,059
I'm gonna give the light to them now.

1146
01:37:02,138 --> 01:37:05,638
No one's allowed to make fun of me anymore.

1147
01:37:18,321 --> 01:37:20,461
Thank you, Hedwig.

1148
01:37:24,694 --> 01:37:26,484
Everything's fine now.

1149
01:37:26,562 --> 01:37:28,332
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1150
01:37:30,566 --> 01:37:32,416
Kevin is asleep.

1151
01:37:32,502 --> 01:37:34,662
We've made him sleep far away.

1152
01:37:34,737 --> 01:37:39,137
You can call his name all you like,
dear, but he's not going to hear you.

1153
01:37:40,376 --> 01:37:43,366
The Beast has shared with us his dream

1154
01:37:43,446 --> 01:37:46,636
of a larger group to sustain him.

1155
01:37:46,716 --> 01:37:48,296
No.

1156
01:37:48,384 --> 01:37:52,044
Ten to 12 unworthy young next time.

1157
01:37:53,756 --> 01:37:56,186
This is just

1158
01:37:56,759 --> 01:37:58,159
the start.

1159
01:39:18,141 --> 01:39:19,211
Let go!

1160
01:39:54,310 --> 01:39:55,780
Help!

1161
01:39:57,847 --> 01:40:00,547
No! No!

1162
01:40:06,322 --> 01:40:07,492
No.

1163
01:40:19,169 --> 01:40:20,169
No.

1164
01:40:22,372 --> 01:40:24,342
It runs in our family.

1165
01:40:25,341 --> 01:40:27,631
My daddy died, too.

1166
01:40:27,710 --> 01:40:29,400
Same way.

1167
01:40:29,479 --> 01:40:30,809
Heart attack.

1168
01:40:33,549 --> 01:40:35,439
But you don't need to worry.

1169
01:40:35,518 --> 01:40:36,788
I'm going to take care of you.

1170
01:40:40,690 --> 01:40:41,620
Now,

1171
01:40:42,892 --> 01:40:45,732
you won't be giving me any trouble, will you?

1172
01:40:46,562 --> 01:40:48,662
I know you won't, sweetie.

1173
01:41:09,752 --> 01:41:12,892
We are glorious!

1174
01:41:14,224 --> 01:41:17,294
We will no longer be afraid.

1175
01:41:27,002 --> 01:41:30,342
Only through pain

1176
01:41:31,607 --> 01:41:33,737
can you achieve your greatness!

1177
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:54,720
The impure are the untouched,

1178
01:41:54,797 --> 01:41:58,527
the unburned, the unslain.

1179
01:42:01,504 --> 01:42:07,904
Those who have not been torn
have no value in themselves

1180
01:42:07,977 --> 01:42:12,337
and no place in this world!

1181
01:42:12,415 --> 01:42:15,715
They are asleep!

1182
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:35,870
Fuck!

1183
01:42:36,939 --> 01:42:40,639
Your gun cannot hurt me.

1184
01:42:41,877 --> 01:42:45,247
Can't you see I am not human?

1185
01:42:47,617 --> 01:42:50,747
Kevin is a man. I am much more.

1186
01:44:22,578 --> 01:44:26,048
You are different from the rest.

1187
01:44:36,626 --> 01:44:39,996
Your heart is pure!

1188
01:44:41,864 --> 01:44:43,974
Rejoice!

1189
01:44:49,872 --> 01:44:53,682
The broken are the more evolved.

1190
01:44:59,849 --> 01:45:02,519
Rejoice.

1191
01:46:03,078 --> 01:46:05,618
What in the name of Mary and Joseph?

1192
01:46:07,016 --> 01:46:09,546
What are you doing in this area?

1193
01:46:50,325 --> 01:46:52,575
Just keep walking, honey.

1194
01:46:52,662 --> 01:46:54,002
They won't do nothing.

1195
01:47:30,032 --> 01:47:33,022
Vince, call the police.

1196
01:47:33,102 --> 01:47:36,072
She said some people got hurt
in the area below maintenance.

1197
01:47:57,226 --> 01:47:58,226
Okay.

1198
01:48:01,196 --> 01:48:03,066
Now, I'm just gonna check you.

1199
01:48:44,774 --> 01:48:47,064
Third deceased name of Dr. Karen Fletcher.

1200
01:48:47,142 --> 01:48:49,342
Still trying to locate the family.

1201
01:49:06,862 --> 01:49:08,802
Casey Cooke's guardian's here.

1202
01:49:19,274 --> 01:49:21,084
Your uncle's here.

1203
01:49:22,745 --> 01:49:24,305
You ready to go?

1204
01:50:13,963 --> 01:50:15,463
It didn't go through.

1205
01:50:20,903 --> 01:50:24,443
We are what we believe we are.

1206
01:50:30,212 --> 01:50:32,742
Holy shit!

1207
01:50:32,815 --> 01:50:35,195
This is so cool!

1208
01:50:38,487 --> 01:50:41,117
They're gonna believe we exist now, right?

1209
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:45,429
They're gonna have to.

1210
01:50:48,197 --> 01:50:50,227
So what do we do now?

1211
01:50:54,036 --> 01:50:55,366
We trust in him.

1212
01:50:57,973 --> 01:50:59,313
He'll protect us.

1213
01:51:01,043 --> 01:51:04,353
Look at what he can do.

1214
01:51:06,415 --> 01:51:10,145
Let him show the world
how powerful we can be.

1215
01:51:19,895 --> 01:51:22,345
The suspected murderer Kevin Crumb

1216
01:51:22,431 --> 01:51:26,491
suffers from the controversial
psychological disorder DID.

1217
01:51:26,568 --> 01:51:30,088
The rumors coming out of the scene
are almost unbelievable.

1218
01:51:30,172 --> 01:51:33,902
There are conflicting stories
if the suspect is alive or dead

1219
01:51:33,976 --> 01:51:36,766
after sustaining two point-blank gunshots.

1220
01:51:36,846 --> 01:51:39,326
Reports even indicate
one of his personalities

1221
01:51:39,414 --> 01:51:44,044
is an amalgam of the various animals
in the Philadelphia Zoo where he worked.

1222
01:51:44,119 --> 01:51:47,039
The press is already referring
to the alleged attacker

1223
01:51:47,122 --> 01:51:51,012
by a dark name leaked by
a source close to the case.

1224
01:51:51,093 --> 01:51:53,883
Because of his many personalities,
he is being called...

1225
01:51:53,963 --> 01:51:55,033
The Horde.

1226
01:51:56,531 --> 01:52:01,391
This is like that crazy guy in the
wheelchair that they put away 15 years ago.

1227
01:52:01,470 --> 01:52:03,970
And they gave him a funny name, too.

1228
01:52:04,874 --> 01:52:06,414
What was it?

1229
01:52:07,076 --> 01:52:08,456
Mr. Glass.

1230
01:52:08,543 --> 01:52:09,513
Oh, yeah.
